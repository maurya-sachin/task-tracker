### ✅ Your Progressive Project Roadmap (Frontend → Fullstack)

#### 🟢 **Project 1: Task Tracker (Grouped by Date)**
>
> Like a mini Jira notification list – exactly what was asked in your interview

**Tech:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind  
**Goals:**

- Read static JSON or mock API
- Group tasks by date (`"Today"`, `"Yesterday"`, `"Last Week"`…)
- Sort tasks by due date
- Filter by status/priority

**What You’ll Learn:**

- Date sorting and grouping logic (🔥)
- Reusable components (TaskCard, TaskList, Filters)
- Good Git commit practice

➡️ **Start here** — I’ll help you plan it below 👇

#### 🟡 **Project 2: Job Application Tracker (Frontend + Later Backend)**
>
> Track jobs you applied to, their status (applied, interview, rejected), and sort by date

**Tech:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, React Query  
**Goals:**

- Use localStorage or mock API
- Filters by job title/status
- Sort by date
- UI with sections per status
- Add/Edit/Delete jobs

**Bonus:** Convert this to fullstack later using Node.js & MongoDB

---

#### 🔵 **Project 3: Kanban Board Clone**
>
> You already started this – let’s level it up

**Tech:** React, Redux Toolkit, React DnD, TypeScript  
**Improvements:**

- Add localStorage or backend
- Add due dates, descriptions, comments
- Sort tasks within columns by priority/date
- Export/Import board JSON

---

#### 🟣 **Project 4: Dev Portfolio CMS (Advanced SEO + Admin Panel)**
>
> Show your projects dynamically from CMS or your own backend

**Tech:** Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript, Framer Motion  
**Optional:** Strapi/Sanity or your custom backend

Would you like me to generate:

- The full **starter code structure** for this project?
- A **step-by-step checklist** so you can follow it easily?
- OR both?

Let’s get building. This will improve your logic and give you a project worth showing!
